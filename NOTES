Just random thoughts as I tinker along...

CodeIgniter aims to be simple, but the last of command link to create db/schema
is a pita for new apps. There are classes to do the lifting, but still...

CodeIgniter lacks partial views, or CakePHP-like elements. Includes fill the
need in simple cases. $this->load->view() seems hacky.

Django seems week on partial views. Custom tags are a pita compared to
other frameworks partial views. includes work for simple issues.
